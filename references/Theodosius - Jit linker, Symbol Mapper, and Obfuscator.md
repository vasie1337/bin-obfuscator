[Introduction and Preamble](#intro)
-----------------------------------

* * *

Existing software protection frameworks typically operate at a small range of compilation levels. The highest level of obfuscation typically operates upon source code directly (source2source), the second highest level is LLVM IR (via optimization passes), and the third and final most common is upon the native binary image (bin2bin).

In this post I will present a framework that works to obfuscate code at the linker level. I will talk about the implications of obfuscating code at such a level and why it ’s not really applicable for a commercial software product. I will also discuss the compilation process of C/C++ code to aid in the explanation of where this framework fits.

There is lots of fun to be had at the linker level as you have full control over the placement of symbols, and said code can have the pleasure of being obfuscated by all other levels detailed above (source2source, IR level, and bin2bin). The linker level also acts as a great stepping stone to bin2bin type obfuscation as much of the file formatting is the same. I highly recommend writing obfuscation at the linker level prior to directly writing anything for native binary images.

Lastly, I would like to state that this project is not even close to a competitor to any existing public code obfuscation framework. Infact, I would much rather point you to existing LLVM IR obfuscation than my own project as it is not capable of capturing semantics, but rather, it excels in native instruction substitution, native instruction virtualization (will be demonstrated in a later post), and symbol placement (mixing code and data). Again, It would be illogical for me to market or present this framework as anything other than a proof of concept, and a fun toy. In addition I want to truly drive home the point that I am not releasing a code obfuscator, but a code obfuscation framework. The code I am releasing is only limited by your imagination, it is not a rigid final product, but an open book, clearly documented. I find it important to make this clear, in text, so that my intent or implications are not falsely interpreted. With that out of the way, I humbly present an obfuscation framework of which operates at the linker level.

_In sum, and contextual points for the rest of the post:_

*   Theodosius is an obfuscation framework which operates at the linker level (operates upon COFF and lib files). It is not a software protector itself, just a framework.
*   Theodosius does not capture the semantics of the code, nor does it generate control flow graphs, basic blocks, or other higher level abstractions of native routines. This is out of the scope of the framework itself, but could be implemented in obfuscation passes.
*   Theodosius intends to map code and data directly into virtual memory rather than generating a new COFF file. However, generation of a new COFF file is possible. The code responsible for the creation of a new COFF file is out of the scope of the framework itself and should be implemented by whomever inherits Theodosius.
*   Theodosius is intended to only work with MSVC compatible COFF files.
*   Theodosius is intended to only work with 64bit x86 instructions.
*   Theodosius has no concept or support for SEH, CET, jump tables, or thread local storage. Refer to the readme as to how to generate code that will work with Theodosius.

[LLVM IR Level Obfuscation](#llvm-ir)
-------------------------------------

* * *

When considering an obfuscation that utilises LLVM IR, typically this means you must recompile your project using clang in addition to the obfuscation pass ([LLVM-Obfuscator](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator) ). This can imply restrictions upon the end consumer such that they may consider other options, however the inverse is true, a native instruction/file format agnostic obfuscation method could provide a “one size fits all” solution. A good application for such a thing could be [android native binaries](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis) (shared objects) which can be of arm, arm64, and even x86 (some phones run x86). This, however, is not the only application of LLVM IR for obfuscation.

![](/llvm-ir-level-obfuscation.drawio.svg)

Another method to get at obfuscation via LLVM IR would be to use [mcsema](https://github.com/lifting-bits/mcsema) on a completely compiled binary. This would allow you to lift an entire binary to LLVM IR where you could then run obfuscation passes upon it prior to recompilation. This would remove the need to recompile source code to achieve obfuscation, therefore less integration required. This however raises questions in terms of the ability of [mcsema](https://github.com/lifting-bits/mcsema) to semantically represent x86 in terms of LLVM IR instructions. In addition, how well it can preserve things such as SEH which is more of an operating system/binary level type concept. After all, LLVM IR must respect its obligations to being agnostic.

_Pros of obfuscating code at the LLVM IR level_

*   Agnostic of native instruction set and therefore offering obfuscation for any target that LLVM can compile too.
*   The IR represents the semantics of the underlying code and therefore more intelligent and complex obfuscation can be created. Such is the case for MBA and CFG.
*   Code obfuscated by LLVM IR can be further obfuscated by bin2bin and linker level obfuscation.

_Cons of obfuscating code at the LLVM IR level_

*   Code (most likely) will need to be recompiled with clang in addition to the obfuscation pass.
*   Integration into the compilation process can cause a headache for the project manager as the project will have to tailor its compiler to clang.

[Bin2Bin Obfuscation](#bin2bin)
-------------------------------

* * *

Binary to binary obfuscation takes away the annoyance and complications of incorporating anything into the compilation process of your project. However bin2bin is not trivial at all and usually is done incorrectly. In addition, bin2bin obfuscators are typically “dumb” in the sense that they are unable to capture the semantics of a function. Consider [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) , which is bin2bin, the three main obfuscation techniques offered by said product are: [deadstore obfuscation](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#deadstore-obfuscation-example) , [opaque branching obfuscation](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#opaque-branching) , and most significantly, [native instruction virtualization](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#overview-virtual-machine) (with MBA to further obscure the arithmetic done inside of the virtual machine). All three of these obfuscation techniques do not require knowledge of the function ’s semantics. In comparison, [OLLVM’s control flow flattening](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening) requires semantic awareness of a function to rewrite its control flow (branches) into a while loop with a switch case.

![](/bin2bin-level-obfuscation.drawio.svg)

Additionally, bin2bin requires intimate knowledge of the native file format and the native instruction set. Moreover, knowledge of processor security features which the operating system may utilise must be taken into consideration. Such is the case for [CET](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/technical-look-control-flow-enforcement-technology.html) (for x86 processors) which aims to make ROP exploits a thing of the past by utilising a shadow stack to keep track of return addresses. This places restrictions on how software protectors can obfuscate control flow in terms of the RET instruction. As we speak [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) is not [CET](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/technical-look-control-flow-enforcement-technology.html) compatible, for there [VMEXIT handler](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#vm_exit) essentially uses the RET instruction as a substitute for the native [CALL](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/call) instruction.

                        `vmexit_handler+0x0:  48 89 ec                   mov    rsp,rbp vmexit_handler+0x3:  58                         pop    rax vmexit_handler+0x4:  5b                         pop    rbx vmexit_handler+0x5:  41 5f                      pop    r15 vmexit_handler+0x7:  5b                         pop    rbx vmexit_handler+0x8:  58                         pop    rax vmexit_handler+0x9:  41 5b                      pop    r11 vmexit_handler+0xb:  5f                         pop    rdi vmexit_handler+0xc:  41 58                      pop    r8 vmexit_handler+0xe:  5a                         pop    rdx vmexit_handler+0xf:  41 59                      pop    r9 vmexit_handler+0x11: 41 5a                      pop    r10 vmexit_handler+0x13: 41 5c                      pop    r12 vmexit_handler+0x15: 5d                         pop    rbp vmexit_handler+0x16: 9d                         popf vmexit_handler+0x17: 59                         pop    rcx vmexit_handler+0x18: 59                         pop    rcx vmexit_handler+0x19: 41 5e                      pop    r14 vmexit_handler+0x1b: 5e                         pop    rsi vmexit_handler+0x1c: 41 5d                      pop    r13 vmexit_handler+0x1e: c3                         ret`

It is my opinion that not a single _public_ bin2bin software protector is worth your money. Regardless of the lack of decent public tooling for [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) or [Oreans Code Virtualizer](https://www.oreans.com/CodeVirtualizer.php) , there is private tooling for these protectors. These protectors pose little to no difficulty against a team of educated reverse engineers. I drew this conclusion myself when creating [my tooling for VMProtect 2](https://git.back.engineering/vmp2/) and [VMProtect 3](https://git.back.engineering/vmp3/) . Considering that I was a lone reverse engineer with little to no prior experience with deobfuscation/devirtualization when I took the challenge upon myself to create useful tooling against [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) , which I was arguably successful in doing.

Due to my research I have had the ability to see a wide range of private tooling, all of which massively nullify the protections of these public protectors. Do not be lulled into thinking that these protectors are difficult or impossible to remove simply because you cannot clone a repository off of github to remove the obfuscation.

My claims can and will be backed up as time progresses. For now, I will end this passage with the following: recently there was a full devirtualization of [BattlEye’s](https://www.battleye.com/) kernel component (which is protected with [VMProtect 3](https://vmpsoft.com/) ). This devirtualization is unparalleled to public tooling and restores the image almost to near original assembly. A link to this image is provided below.

[https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file &id=36229](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=36229)

Furthermore, it is my opinion that [Code Virtualizer (CV)](https://www.oreans.com/CodeVirtualizer.php) and the products built upon it, such as [Themida](https://www.oreans.com/Themida.php) and [WinLicense](https://www.oreans.com/WinLicense.php) , are not viable products for CV has an abundance of semantic inaccuracies in its native instruction virtualization, this only gets exacerbated by their nested virtualization. The only obfuscation that is worth your money is obfuscation that is semantically correct. Even more, [Code Virtualizer](https://www.oreans.com/CodeVirtualizer.php) cannot handle switch cases without macros, which even [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) has been able to completely handle since version 2.x.

Additionally, macros must be used for try-except/try-finally blocks. You may be tempted to think that this is a feature to allow the end user to control what should be protected. Rather, it is poor engineering that requires the end user to provide information so that it can barely work.

Moreover, [Code Virtualizer](https://www.oreans.com/codevirtualizer.php) only allows a single thread inside of the virtual machine at a time. This is because the virtual machines context is not allocated upon the stack like [VMProtect’s virtual machine context](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#overview-virtual-machine) is. [Code Virtualizer](https://www.oreans.com/codevirtualizer.php) utilises a spinlock on every virtual machine enter to ensure only a single thread is executing inside of the virtual machine.

![](/cv-spinlock-lol.png)

For multi threaded programs this completely nullifies the purpose of having more than a single thread. With all of this in mind, it is truly baffling that [Code Virtualizer](https://www.oreans.com/codevirtualizer.php) offers protection for Windows kernel drivers. I hope no company is fooled into using this protector to obfuscate a kernel component.

I find it interesting that Oreans is willing to market such a product regardless of its known issues. I think their engineers are smart enough to know their software protectors shortcomings, yet they still present their product as though it offers unparalleled protection. Definitely raises the question as to who their products target? No legitimate company would use Code Virtualizer if they knew the risks entailed. I think what this all boils down too is that Oreans is taking advantage of ignorant customers selling them a product that their own engineers know is not stable, extremely slow, and far behind other protectors. They use their feature list to impress potential buyers when in reality, none of the features matter if none of it is stable.

> _Have a look at the feature list yourself:_ [https://www.oreans.com/codevirtualizer.php#two](https://www.oreans.com/codevirtualizer.php#two)

My negative opinions of existing bin2bin protectors has been further amplified as of recently. This is due to the fact that I have witnessed technology in development that addresses all of the complex difficulties related to bin2bin.

_Pros of bin2bin_

*   Little to no compilation requirements/integration
*   Much easier to integrate into a project

_Cons of bin2bin_

*   Extremely difficult to do correctly. Not a single public bin2bin protector is worth your money as I explain in the paragraphs above.
*   Requires intimate knowledge of the native file format
*   Requires intimate knowledge of the instruction set
*   Requires intimate knowledge of the processor security features and how the operating system may utilise them (CET, data alignment checks/AC Bit in EFLAGS).
*   Typical bin2bin obfuscation is “dumb” and cannot/does not capture semantics.

[Linker Level Obfuscation](#linker-level)
-----------------------------------------

* * *

So considering the above two levels of obfuscation, where does a “linker level” obfuscation framework lay? The linker level gets the short end of both sticks from bin2bin and IR level. It requires integration into the compilation process and it is bound to a single instruction set. In addition this level of obfuscation requires intimate knowledge of the COFF file format.

However, regardless of these requirements, the linker level offers a unique ability that other levels of obfuscation cannot offer. The linker level allows you to freely position code and data how you see fit. Additionally, code can be obfuscated at the IR level prior to further being obfuscated at the linker level. You can envision obfuscation at the linker level as being synonymous with bin2bin with the added support of symbol placement.

![](/linker-level-obfuscation.drawio.svg)

If it ’s not clear by now, doing obfuscation at the linker level is not viable in a commercial software protector manner. For we would have seen such a product already due to market forces, there is simply no demand for this type of product. Instead, I find obfuscation at this level to be a fantastic stepping stone to bin2bin obfuscation. For me and others, this is a great place to learn.

_Pros of linker level obfuscation_

*   Control over symbol placement
*   Control over linking symbols together

_Cons of linker level obfuscation_

*   All the same cons as bin2bin
*   Requires integration into the compilation process

[Brief Overview Of Theodosius](#Brief-Overview-Of-Theodosius)
-------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

Theodosius operates upon COFF files. It substitutes the role of the linker and instead of generating a native file it allows you, the programmer, to obfuscate symbols, control over symbol placement, and lastly control over both static and dynamic linking. There are three main modules to Theo, decomposition (decomp), obfuscation (obf), and recomposition (recomp).

#### [Decomposition Module](#Decomposition-Module)

* * *

The first component, decomposition, is used to break down COFF files into manageable data structures which contain metadata about COFF symbols (data symbols, functions, sections, etc). These metadata objects are then used throughout the rest of the framework. The most important classes used for decomposition are detailed below. They are also defined in the doxygen generated for this project.

*   [theo::decomp::decomp\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d6/d0e/classtheo_1_1decomp_1_1decomp__t.html) class contains wrapper code to decompose a lib file. It is the highest level class used in decomposition.
*   [theo::decomp::symbol\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d9/dd5/classtheo_1_1decomp_1_1symbol__t.html) class is extremely important to understand as it is used to describe all symbols.

#### [Obfuscation Module](#Obfuscation-Module)

* * *

The second module in Theo is the obfuscation system. The obfuscation system consists of a singleton engine ([theo::obf::engine\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d9/d18/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1engine__t.html) ), and a base class pass template ([theo::obf::pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d4/dad/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1pass__t.html) ). Obfuscation passes are created by defining a class that inherits [theo::obf::pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d4/dad/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1pass__t.html) , overloading the [virtual run method](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d4/dad/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1pass__t.html#acfadc013ff0754d66a18baffdb1a61d1) , and finally adding it to the obfuscation engine. The responsibility of adding passes to the engine rests upon the code base that inherits Theo. In other words, Theo does not run any passes by default, it ’s entirely up to the programmer submoduling Theo to set up the passes and their order. The most important classes used for obfuscation are detailed below. They are also defined in the doxygen generated for this project.

*   [theo::obf::engine\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d9/d18/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1engine__t.html) this is a singleton class which is used to keep track of passes and their order of execution. You can get a reference to this object by calling [theo::obf::engine\_t::get](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d9/d18/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1engine__t.html#a58715f5c3ade824a65e602aba570040e) . You can then add passes with the [add\_pass](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d9/d18/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1engine__t.html#a8ffc963a133653fa3a0875798d0d3426) function. Here is an example of that:

                            `// order matters, the order in which the pass is added is the order they                                                                  // will be executed!                                                                  //                                                                  auto                                 engine =                                 theo::                                 obf::                                 engine_t::                                 get(); 	  	 // add in our hello world pass here                                                                  //                                                                  engine->                                 add_pass(theo::                                 obf::                                 hello_world_pass_t::                                 get()); 	  	 // add the rest of the passes in this order. this order is important.                                                                  //                                                                  engine->                                 add_pass(theo::                                 obf::                                 reloc_transform_pass_t::                                 get()); 	 engine->                                 add_pass(theo::                                 obf::                                 next_inst_pass_t::                                 get()); 	 engine->                                 add_pass(theo::                                 obf::                                 jcc_rewrite_pass_t::                                 get());`


                            
                        

*   [theo::obf::pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d4/dad/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1pass__t.html) is the base class for all passes. There is a single virtual method, [run](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d4/dad/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1pass__t.html#acfadc013ff0754d66a18baffdb1a61d1) , that must be overloaded when inheriting this class. In addition, it is highly suggested that you make all passes singleton with a private constructor. Consider the following code for [jcc\_rewrite\_pass](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d6/dc1/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1jcc__rewrite__pass__t.html) :

                            `class                                 jcc_rewrite_pass_t                                 :                                 public                                 pass_t { 	   // call the parent constructor and tell it we only want “instruction” type symbols…                                                                  explicit                                 jcc_rewrite_pass_t                                 () :                                 pass_t(decomp::                                 sym_type_t::                                 instruction) {} 	 public                                 :                                 static                                 jcc_rewrite_pass_t*                                 get(); 	   void                                 run                                 (decomp::                                 symbol_t*                                 sym); 	};`

                            
                        

#### [Recomposition Module](#Recomposition-Module)

* * *

The last module to Theo is recomposition. This module is responsible for allocating space for symbols, resolving references to symbols, and copying symbols into memory. All three, allocation, symbol resolution, and memory copying are completely determined by the programmer. This allows the framework to be extremely open ended in its application. Symbol resolution within the COFF files themselves is handled by Theo. Any external symbols call upon the supplied resolver lambda function the programmer provides the framework.

The most important classes/data types used for recomposition are detailed below. They are also defined in the doxygen generated for this project.

[Theodosius Internals](#Theodosius-Internals)
---------------------------------------------

* * *

Let ’s move onto some of the internals of Theodosius as I think it ’s important to discuss such things as how relocations are handled, how routines are split into individual instructions, how function length is determined, and how `.rdata` /`.data` section symbols are handled.

To begin, when the compiler generates a COFF file, each symbol will have its own section up until there are `65535` sections, after which symbols will share sections with liked characteristics. For code/data/rdata/bss, this means symbols can have their own section and/or share a section with other symbols depending upon how many other symbols have already been declared in the COFF file. Although Theodosius aims to provide control over symbol placement, it will not split `.data` /`.rdata` /`.bss` symbols apart which reside in the same section. The reason being: some data structures may have multiple data symbols referencing inside of them.

![](/data-section-struct-with-multi-syms.drawio.png)

This makes it extremely difficult to determine the actual size of the data. For this reason, data symbol sizes are calculated by the size of the section that contains them. Lastly, BSS symbols (zero initialised symbols) are handled in the same manner as other `.data` /`.rdata` symbols.

![](/max-section-limit-multi-symbols.drawio.svg)

Code on the other hand can be calculated by determining the distance between the start of the function and the beginning of the next symbol in the same section. If there are no other code symbols in the section then the size of the section itself is used as the size of the function. Determining size of functions in this manner offers a massive performance boost in comparison to recursively disassembling every function to determine the very last instruction. However, the method that Theo performs includes padding instructions (such at int3’s) into the function and its size.

![](/getting-function-size.drawio.svg)

During the decomposition stage of Theo a symbol is determined either code, data, or bss by looking at the characteristics of symbol type (it does not use section characteristics to deduce symbol type).

                            `if                                 (sym->                                 derived_type ==                                 coff::                                 derived_type_id::                                 function &&                                 sym->                                 storage_class !=                                 coff::                                 storage_class_id::                                 external_definition &&                                 sym->                                 has_section()) {   auto                                 scn =                                 img->                                 get_section(sym->                                 section_index -                                 1                                 );   auto                                 dcmp_type =                                 scn->                                 name.to_string(img->                                 get_strings()) ==                                 INSTR_SPLIT_SECTION_NAME         ?                                 decomp::                                 sym_type_t::                                 instruction         : decomp::                                 sym_type_t::                                 function;            auto                                 fn_size =                                 next_sym(img, scn, sym);   auto                                 fn_bgn =                                 scn->                                 ptr_raw_data +                                 reinterpret_cast                                 <                                 std::                                 uint8_t                                 *>                                 (img) +                                 sym->                                 value;                  std::                                 vector<                                 std::                                 uint8_t                                 >                                 fn(fn_bgn, fn_bgn +                                 fn_size);   decomp::                                 routine_t rtn(sym, img, scn, fn, dcmp_type);      auto                                 syms =                                 rtn.decompose();   m_syms->                                 put_symbols(syms); }`

                            
                        

The above code is wrapper code contained inside of the decomp\_t class to handle decomposition of functions. It ’s important to understand that any function that is stored inside of a section with the name `.split` will result in the functions decomposition into individual instructions rather than a single symbol containing the entire function.

Another thing to note is that the size of the function is determined by subtracting the address of the next symbol in the same section. This solves the problem of multiple functions located inside of the same section. If there is only a single symbol/function in the section then the address of the end of the section is returned.

                            `auto                                 fn_size =                                 next_sym(img, scn, sym); auto                                 fn_bgn =                                 scn->                                 ptr_raw_data +                                 reinterpret_cast                                 <                                 std::                                 uint8_t                                 *>                                 (img) +                                 sym->                                 value;                std::                                 vector<                                 std::                                 uint8_t                                 >                                 fn(fn_bgn, fn_bgn +                                 fn_size);`

                            
                        

Let ’s take a closer look into how functions are decomposed as it will answer how relocations are handled. When a function is decomposed into a sequence of [theo::decomp::symbol\_t’s](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d9/dd5/classtheo_1_1decomp_1_1symbol__t.html) any relocations inside of that routine are passed along to the symbol\_t. However relocations are rebased to be from the beginning of the routine (or instruction).

                            `std::                                 vector<                                 recomp::                                 reloc_t>                                 relocs; auto                                 scn_relocs =                                 reinterpret_cast                                 <                                 coff::                                 reloc_t*>                                 (     m_scn->                                 ptr_relocs +                                 reinterpret_cast                                 <                                 std::                                 uint8_t                                 *>                                 (m_img)); for                                 (auto                                 idx =                                 0u                                 ; idx <                                 m_scn->                                 num_relocs; ++                                 idx) {   auto                                 scn_reloc =                                 &                                 scn_relocs[idx];   // if the reloc is in the current function...                                                                  if                                 (scn_reloc->                                 virtual_address >=                                 m_sym->                                 value &&                                 scn_reloc->                                 virtual_address <                                 m_sym->                                 value +                                 m_data.size()) {     auto                                 sym_reloc =                                 m_img->                                 get_symbol(scn_relocs[idx].symbol_index);     auto                                 sym_name =                                 symbol_t::                                 name(m_img, sym_reloc);     auto                                 sym_hash =                                 decomp::                                 symbol_t::                                 hash(sym_name.data());     relocs.push_back(         recomp::                                 reloc_t(scn_reloc->                                 virtual_address -                                 m_sym->                                 value,                         sym_hash, sym_name.data()));   } } result.push_back(decomp::                                 symbol_t(     m_img, symbol_t::                                 name(m_img, m_sym).data(), m_sym->                                 value, m_data,     m_scn, m_sym, relocs, sym_type_t::                                 function));`

                            
                        

The same logic applies to instructions, however relocations are rebased to the beginning of the instruction.

#### [Recursive Symbol Dependency Check](#Recursive-Symbol-Dependency-Check)

* * *

Another important topic to discuss is how Theo determines which symbols are used and which symbols are not. When you compile a static library, all functions, regardless if they are referenced at all in the C/C++ source code will be compiled into the static library. This makes sense as the functions needed when statically linking with external code is unknown at the time of compilation of the static library itself, therefore all functions are included. Mapping all of these symbols is wildly inefficient as you can imagine. Therefore Theo implements a recursive symbol walk to determine all of the symbols that are used.

This is not a new concept as linkers themselves implement this very same functionality. Other forms of this can be observed in the process of decompilation, where code and data are uncovered by recursively following call instructions and tracking all references to data and functions (IDA does this).

Consider the following code (main.cpp):

                            `void                                 t2                                 () {   puts(“                                 this func never gets called”                                 ); }  void                                 t1                                 (const                                 char                                 *                                 str) {   puts(“                                 T1 is called”                                 );   puts(str); }  int                                 main                                 () {   t1(“                                 hello world”                                 ); }`

                            
                        

The above code will generate 7 (and some extra) symbols into a single COFF file named “main.obj”

*   int main in a `.text` section
*   void t1 in a `.text` section
*   void t2 in a `.text` section
*   A symbol for “puts”, with a storage class of `IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL` , and a section index of 0 indicating that the symbol is not located inside of the COFF file.
*   “hello world” string in a `.rdata` section.
*   “T1 is called” string in a `.rdata` section.
*   “this func never gets called” string in a `.rdata` section

Now consider that “t2” is never called by any code in the file but it will still be present in the generated COFF and archive (lib) file. It would be a waste of resources for Theo to map these unused symbols. For this reason I have implemented the following algorithm to extract the used symbols given an entry point.

                            `std::                                 uint32_t                                 decomp_t::                                 ext_used_syms(const                                 std::                                 string&&                                 entry_sym) {   // start with the entry point symbol...                                                                  std::                                 optional<                                 sym_data_t>                                 entry =                                 get_symbol(entry_sym.data());   // if the entry point symbol cant be found simply return 0 (for 0 symbols                                                                  // extracted)...                                                                  if                                 (!

The last section of information regarding the inner workings of Theo will discuss some intentionally embedded obfuscation and techniques to identify which routines are split up into individual instruction symbols.

Firstly, although Theo could potentially offer the ability to obfuscate code and generate a new COFF file, it was originally created with the intent of mapping and running the code straight from the COFF file after executing all obfuscation passes. For this reason, there exists a few noticeable design decisions which favour that intent.

Secondly, the [theo::recomp::reloc\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/dd/d37/classtheo_1_1recomp_1_1reloc__t.html) structure contains information pertaining to obfuscating the address of relocations. When resolving relocations is performed, Theo will loop through a vector of transformations contained inside of the reloc\_t structure, executing each transformation upon the address of the relocation, ultimately encrypting it. This is a hardcoded concept that doesn ’t necessarily need to be utilised, but it is there if needed.

Thirdly, by default, allocation and resolving symbols is done in terms of linear virtual addresses. Therefore, by default, any code generated by Theodosius is not position independent. It is feasible to circumvent this however with a pass that rewrites relocations to be rip relative.

Lastly, in regards to breaking functions into individual instruction symbols, Theo does this on the basis of the section name that contains the function itself. Any function which is declared inside of a section with the name `.split` will result in the function’s decompilation into individual instruction symbols.

#### [Theodosius Internal Passes](#Theodosius-Internal-Passes)

* * *

Theodosius contains a few internal passes. These passes handle boilerplate scenarios and can be built on top of easily. Additionally, these passes are optional and don ’t need to be utilised.

The three internal obfuscation passes offered are the following:

*   [theo::obf::jcc\_rewrite\_pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d6/dc1/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1jcc__rewrite__pass__t.html)
*   [theo::obf::next\_inst\_pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d5/d08/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1next__inst__pass__t.html)
*   [theo::obf::reloc\_transform\_pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/dc/d39/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1reloc__transform__pass__t.html)

#### [next\_inst\_pass\_t](#next_inst_pass_t)

* * *

This pass is used to generate transformations and jmp code to change RIP to the next instruction. Given the following code (get pml4 address from cr3):

                            `get_pml4:     mov                                 rax                                 ,0xfff                                 ; 0:  48 c7 c0 ff 0f 00 00                                                                    not                                 rax                                 ; 7:  48 f7 d0                                                                                mov                                 rdx                                 ,cr3                                 ; a:  0f 20 da                                                                                and                                 rdx                                 ,rax                                 ; d:  48 21 c2                                                                                mov                                 rax                                 ,rdx                                 ; 10: 48 89 d0                                                                                ret                                 ; 1C: c3`                    

                            
                        

This pass will break up each instruction so that it can be anywhere in a linear virtual address space. This pass will not work on rip relative code, however clang will not generate such code when compiled with `-mcmodel=large` .

                            `get_pml4@0:     mov                                 rax                                 , 0xFFF                                 push                                 [next_inst_addr_enc                                 ]     xor                                 [rsp                                 ], 0x3243342                                 ; a random number of transformations here...                                                                  ret                                 next_inst_addr_enc:     ; encrypted address of the next instruction goes here.                                                                  get_pml4@7:     not                                 rax                                 push                                 [next_inst_addr_enc                                 ]     xor                                 [rsp                                 ], 0x93983498                                 ; a random number of transformations here...                                                                  ret                                 next_inst_addr_enc:     ; encrypted address of the next instruction goes here.`

                            
                        

This process is continued for each instruction in the function. The last instruction, RET, will have no code generated for it as there is no next instruction.

This pass also only runs at the instruction level, theodosius internally breaks up functions inside of the `.split` section into individual instruction symbols. This process also creates a pseudo relocation which simply tells this pass that there needs to be a relocation to the next symbol. The offset for these pseudo relocations is zero.

#### [jcc\_rewrite\_pass](#jcc_rewrite_pass)

* * *

This pass rewrites rip relative jcc ’s so that they are position independent.

Given the following code:

                            `jnz                                 label1                                 ; other code goes here                                                                  label1: ; more code here`

                            
                        

The jnz instruction will be rewritten so that the following code is generated:

                            `jnz                                 br2                                 br1: jmp                                 [rip                                 ] ; address after this instruction contains the address                                 ; of the instruction after the jcc.                                                                  br2                                 : jmp                                 [rip                                 ] ; address after this instruction contains the address of where                                 ; branch 2 is located.`

                            
                        

It ’s important to note that other passes will encrypt (transform) the address of the next instruction. There is actually no jmp \[rip\] either, push/ret is used.

#### [reloc\_transform\_pass](#reloc_transform_pass)

* * *

This pass is like the [next\_inst\_pass](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d5/d08/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1next__inst__pass__t.html) , however, relocations are encrypted with transformations instead of the address of the next instruction. This pass only runs at the instruction level and appends transformations into the reloc\_t object of the instruction symbol.

Given the following code:

                            `mov                                 rax                                 , cs                                 :MessageBoxA`
                            
                        

This pass will generate a random number of transformations to encrypt the address of “MessageBoxA ”. These transformations will then be applied by theodosius internally when resolving relocations.

                            `mov                                 rax                                 , enc_MessageBoxA                                 xor                                 rax                                 , 0x389284324                                 add                                 rax                                 , 0x345332567                                 ror                                 rax                                 , 0x5353`

Theodosius comes with a demonstration project and a few static libraries for testing purposes. These are meant to be built on Windows platforms only, however Theodosius itself can compile for linux (follow the readme for instructions).

It ’s important to note that this code is from the inheritor of theodosius ’s perspective. Therefore it ’s the programmers responsibility to call [xed\_tables\_init](https://intelxed.github.io/ref-manual/group__INIT.html#details) . In addition, you can see that the programmer is the one who has control over the obfuscation passes and the order in which they run.

The example simply registers the built in obfuscation passes to run with the addition of the [hello\_world\_pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d5/d6a/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1hello__world__pass__t.html) .

[Creating A Pass](#Creating-A-Pass)
-----------------------------------

* * *

To create a pass for Theodosius, one must define a class that publicly inherits the [theo::obf::pass\_t](https://docs.back.engineering/theo/d4/dad/classtheo_1_1obf_1_1pass__t.html) base class. This class that is defined should be a singleton class with a private constructor which invokes the parent constructor. Refer to the following code:

                            `class                                 hello_world_pass_t                                 :                                 public                                 pass_t {   hello_world_pass_t() :                                 pass_t(decomp::                                 sym_type_t::                                 all) {     spdlog::                                 info("created hello world pass..."                                 );   }  public                                 :                                 static                                 hello_world_pass_t*                                 get() {     static                                 hello_world_pass_t obj;     return                                 &                                 obj;   }   void                                 run                                 (decomp::                                 symbol_t*                                 sym) {     spdlog::                                 info("[hello_world_pass_t] symbol name: {}, symbol hash: {}"                                 ,                  sym->                                 name(), sym->                                 hash());   } };`

                            
                        

When invoking the parent constructor in the private default constructor of your pass you must provide which symbols you want your pass to operate upon. In the example above the hello\_world\_pass\_t operates upon all symbols. A list of all symbols your pass can operate upon are listed below:

[Closing Words and Conclusion](#Conclusion)
-------------------------------------------

* * *

In conclusion, Theodosius is a linker level obfuscation framework which allows a programmer to mess about with native instructions and symbol placement. The framework contains a well documented pass system, and it even comes with an example.

I originally wanted to create a framework that I could use to recreate VMProtect obfuscation techniques to better explain how they work. In my last VMProtect related post I stated the following:

> _“Lastly, during my research of VMProtect 2, there has been a subtle urge to reimplement some of the obfuscation and virtual machine features myself in an open source manner to better convey the features of VMProtect 2. However, after much thought, it would be more productive to create an obfuscation framework that would allow for these ideas to be created with relative ease."_

I will conclude this post by stating that although publicly researching software protectors is fun, it can be damaging to my own image as the tooling can be used in a negative manner. For that I will continue my research in private and publicly focus more on the creation of obfuscation/software protection. As to my comments in regards to Themida/Code Virtualizer they are not meant to be slander, rather constructive criticism. All of the concerns I have raised are legitimate and based in reality.
